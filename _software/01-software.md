All email applications on this page support the OpenPGP standard either directly or with additional software.
The authors of this webpage are not actively participating in the development of each of these third-party apps.
No security audits have been done by us and, thus, we cannot provide any security guarantees.

* [GMX](http://www.gmx.net/)
* [mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/)
* [Posteo](https://posteo.de)
* [WEB.DE](http://web.de/)

## Webmail Provider with In-Browser Cryptography
In contrast to the previous section, the following webmail providers do not require the installation of additional browser plugins, instead OpenPGP is implemented in JavaScript provided directly by the website.
While these are easier to set up and provide basic security guarantees with OpenPGP, [some people don't consider these "end-to-end secure"](https://tonyarcieri.com/whats-wrong-with-webcrypto).

* [Hushmail](https://www.hushmail.com/) (limited OpenPGP support)
* [Mailfence](https://www.mailfence.com/)
* [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) (only incoming OpenPGP support)
